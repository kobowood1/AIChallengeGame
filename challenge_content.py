# The backstory and context for the Republic of Bean policy simulation
SCENARIO_TEXT = """
The Republic of Bean, a small coastal nation, has experienced an unexpected 
influx of 50,000 refugees from neighboring Coffea due to civil unrest. As 
education policy advisors to the Bean Ministry of Education, you must develop 
an inclusive education strategy with limited resources.

Bean is known for its stable but modest economy, with education already 
accounting for 18% of the national budget. The refugees include approximately 
12,000 school-age children who need immediate educational support. Most speak 
a different primary language and have experienced significant trauma and 
disruption to their education.

Your task is to design a comprehensive refugee education policy package that 
balances the needs of the newcomers with those of Bean's citizens. Your 
decisions will affect social cohesion, economic development, and diplomatic 
relations with neighboring countries. The total cost of your policy package 
cannot exceed 14 budget units, and you must select options of different levels 
to create a nuanced approach.

As you deliberate, consider both immediate humanitarian needs and long-term
integration goals. Your recommendations will shape the future of both the 
refugee children and the Republic of Bean for generations to come.

Budget Rule:
The policy package must not exceed MAX_BUDGET (14 units).
Each policy area requires selecting exactly one option.
A balanced approach is required - players must select options of different levels
(cannot choose all Option 1s, all Option 2s, or all Option 3s) to create a more
nuanced and realistic policy package that addresses different aspects with 
varying levels of investment.

Reflection Questions:

1. How did your initial policy package differ from the final adopted package? What 
   factors influenced these changes?

2. Which policy area generated the most debate during deliberation, and why do you 
   think this was the case?

3. How did you balance immediate humanitarian needs with long-term integration 
   goals in your policy decisions?

4. What perspectives did the AI representatives bring that you might not have 
   considered otherwise?

5. How did budget constraints affect your decision-making process? What trade-offs 
   were most difficult?

6. Which policy option do you believe will have the greatest positive impact, and 
   what evidence supports this?

7. How might the policy package be received differently by refugee families versus 
   long-term Bean residents?

8. What additional information would have helped you make more informed policy 
   decisions?

9. How did this exercise change your understanding of education policy challenges 
   in refugee contexts?

10. If you were to implement this policy package in reality, what additional 
    considerations or modifications would you suggest?
