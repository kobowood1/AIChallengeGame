        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Background</h2>
        
        <div class="prose prose-invert">
            <p>Welcome to the Republic of Bean, a small democratic nation facing significant challenges after a period of economic and political stability. In recent years, Bean has experienced an influx of refugees from neighboring countries due to regional conflicts, creating unprecedented pressure on public servicesâ€”particularly the education system.</p>
            
            <p>As a member of parliament, you have been tasked with reforming Bean's education system to better address the needs of both citizens and refugees. The parliament has allocated a limited budget for these reforms, and you must work collaboratively with other representatives (AI-generated agents) to determine the most effective and equitable allocation of resources.</p>
            
            <p>Your decisions will impact generations of students, both native-born citizens and refugees. How will you balance competing interests, navigate political differences, and create a just and inclusive education system under budget constraints?</p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">The Challenge</h2>
        
        <div class="prose prose-invert">
            <p>You will participate in a three-phase process:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Individual Policy Selection:</strong> Select one option from each of seven education policy areas within a 14-unit budget limit.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaborative Dialogue:</strong> Engage in discussion with four AI-generated citizen representatives who have different perspectives. Justify your choices and listen to their arguments.</li>
                <li><strong>Democratic Decision:</strong> Through majority voting, create a final education policy package that stays within budget.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>After the process concludes, you'll reflect on the experience, examining how power, values, and constraints shaped your decisions and the group's outcome.</p>

    <div class="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg mb-6">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Policy Areas</h2>
        
        <div class="prose prose-invert">
            <p>You will make decisions on these seven critical education policy areas:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Access to Education:</strong> How will educational institutions accommodate refugee students?</li>
                <li><strong>Language Instruction:</strong> What approach to language learning will best support integration?</li>
                <li><strong>Teacher Training:</strong> How will educators be prepared to work with diverse students?</li>
                <li><strong>Curriculum Adaptation:</strong> How should content be modified to be inclusive and relevant?</li>
                <li><strong>Psychosocial Support:</strong> What mental health resources should be provided?</li>
                <li><strong>Financial Support:</strong> What economic assistance will help refugee students succeed?</li>
                <li><strong>Certification/Accreditation:</strong> How will prior education be recognized and validated?</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>For each area, you'll choose from three options representing different approaches and resource investments.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg mb-6">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Budget Constraints</h2>
        
        <div class="prose prose-invert">
            <p>The parliamentary budget committee has allocated 14 resource units for education reform. Each policy option costs between 1-3 units, reflecting the relative investment required:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Level 1 (1 unit):</strong> Basic implementation with minimal resources</li>
                <li><strong>Level 2 (2 units):</strong> Moderate implementation with average resources</li>
                <li><strong>Level 3 (3 units):</strong> Comprehensive implementation with significant resources</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>You must carefully balance idealism with pragmatism. Your selections must not exceed the 14-unit limit.</p>
