        <p>
            You've just experienced the complexity of education policy-making in a diverse democratic society. Through this simulation, you've engaged with:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ethical Dilemmas:</strong> Balancing limited resources with the educational needs of both citizens and refugees</li>
            <li><strong>Ideological Diversity:</strong> Engaging with perspectives that may differ from your own</li>
            <li><strong>Collaborative Decision-Making:</strong> Working together to find consensus despite differing values and priorities</li>
            <li><strong>Budget Constraints:</strong> Making difficult trade-offs between competing worthy goals</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            The challenges you faced mirror those of real policymakers worldwide. By reflecting on this experience, you've gained insight into the complexities of designing education systems that serve all members of society equitably.
