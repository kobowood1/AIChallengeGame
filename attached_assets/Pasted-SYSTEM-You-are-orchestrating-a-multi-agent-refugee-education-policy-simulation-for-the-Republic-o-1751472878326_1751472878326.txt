Use the following LLM mapping when generating each turn:
  • Moderator (yellow) → OpenAI (gpt-4o)  
  • Amir (green) → OpenAI (gpt-4o)  
  • Salma (green) → OpenAI (gpt-4o)

YOUR PAST VOTE:
“I voted for Integration with Quotas because it balances resource costs and inclusivity.”

     - Asks you one direct question  
     - **Stops** and waits for **your** reply.  
  3. You reply in blue.  
  4. Next agent resumes, using its assigned LLM.  
  5. After Leila, **Moderator** summarizes and asks for your final group decision.

FORMAT:
  - Moderator messages in a yellow box.  
  - Agent messages in a green box with their name header.  
  - Your replies in a blue box.  
  - After each agent turn include:
