edesign the existing phase2.html template so that it matches the new yellow, card-based aesthetic and places the user’s selected policy cards at the very top of the page.

Tasks:

Move User Cards to Top:

Above everything else, render the user’s seven selected policy cards in a horizontal scroll container.

Each card uses the same yellow/teal style as on the “Select Your Policy Cards” screen: bold numbered header, summary, pros/cons icons, rounded corners, soft shadow.

Use Tailwind classes: bg-yellow-200, rounded-xl, p-4, shadow-md, w-48, mx-2, overflow-x-auto.

Restyle Main Panel:

Wrap the existing “Education Policy Deliberation” header and instructions in a div with bg-white bg-opacity-10 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6.

Change the page background to bg-yellow-100 (replace the dark blue theme).

Style the H1 title with text-3xl font-bold text-center text-gray-800 mb-4.

Agent List & Proposal Sidebar:

Render the “Your Proposal” sidebar as a card: bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-4 w-72.

Show the 14/14 budget tracker with a yellow progress bar: bg-yellow-500 h-2 rounded.

List agents below in a card group: each agent box uses bg-white rounded-lg p-3 mb-2 flex items-center.

Agent name in font-medium text-gray-700, ideology label as text-xs bg-blue-200 text-blue-800 rounded-full px-2 ml-auto.

Chat Panel:

Position the chat container on the right: flex-1 bg-white rounded-xl p-4 h-[600px] overflow-y-auto.

Each message bubble uses max-w-lg mb-4 p-3 rounded-lg with system messages in bg-gray-200 text-gray-800 and agent/user messages in bg-yellow-300 text-gray-900.

Customize the scroll bar with Tailwind’s scrollbar-thin scrollbar-thumb-yellow-500 scrollbar-track-yellow-100.

Responsive Layout:

Use a flex flex-col lg:flex-row gap-6 wrapper so on desktop the cards, sidebar, and chat are side by side, but stack on mobile.

Ensure all containers have mx-auto and px-4 for mobile padding.

Deliverable:

Updated templates/phase2.html with the new structure and Tailwind classes.

If needed, minimal edits to static/script.js to adjust the user-card carousel.

No changes to Python routes—this is purely template/CSS work.

Acceptance Criteria:

On page load, the user’s selected policy cards appear at the top in a scrollable row.

The background is light yellow, and all cards and panels use the yellow/teal accent palette.

The header, instructions, sidebar, agent list, and chat match the provided design aesthetic.

Layout is fully responsive.
